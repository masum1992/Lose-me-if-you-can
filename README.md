<b>How it works?</b> 

Using “Q- Learning “ we made our simple game. In our game we have 15 dices, every time computer or human can pick up 2, 3 or 5 dice from the 15 dices. At the end of the game computer or human who has no moves, he will lose the game. In the development of our simple game we used Q-learning algorithm which is basically machine learning algorithm. This algorithm learns as like babies learns. Applying  all moves, this algorithm memorizes all moves results and assign a reward value after each moves in “Q -matrix” . After training this algorithm uses this “Q- matrix” values to find the optimal moves. And after every play session this algorithm will learn more and more about the games moves and accuracy of giving optimal moves will increase with the play session increases.   

<b>How this will run?</b> 

As this is a simple python representation of our Game. so this initial python code will run on “python 2.7 “ interpreter. We are at the end of our Django representation of our Game . After Django representation people can play this game on online. 

<b>What we have done?</b>

We have implemented our main idea in python language. But very soon we will host this game on online using Django. 

<b>Purpose of the Game?</b>

Simply for fun purpose and an experimental AI model building.
