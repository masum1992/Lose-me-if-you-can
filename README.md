## <b>What is this?</b>

>It is a simple game using simple machine learning algorithm called 'Q-learning'.

## <b>Where it runs?</b>

>On mobile platform as well as in desktop.

## <b>About the game</b>

>It is a game with 15 dice. Each pleyar has specific moves. Each time one pleyar can take 2,3 or 5 dices from the board. At last the pleyar who has no moves, he will lose. it is a deterministic game. 

## <b>How algorithm works?</b> 

In the development of our simple game we used Q-learning algorithm which is basically machine learning algorithm. This algorithm learns as like babies learns. Applying  all moves, this algorithm memorizes all moves effects and assign a reward value after each moves in “Q -matrix” . After training, this algorithm uses this “Q- matrix” values to find the optimal moves. And after every play session this algorithm will learn more and more about the games moves and accuracy of giving optimal moves will increase with the play session increases.  


## <b>What we have done?</b>

Here we have implemented our main idea in python language. But very soon we will convert this game in pygame, so that we can play this game in mobile also. 

# <b>HOW TO RUN THIS</b> ?
 
# <b>Step 0: Requirments.</b>

 - <b>1. Need to installed python 3.
 - <b>2. Install numpy, pygame modules.</b>
 
# <b>Step 1: Download and unzip.
 - Download Lose me if you can.py file.
 - save it in the file in that directory where python.exe is.
